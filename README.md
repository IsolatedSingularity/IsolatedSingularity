- Conducting research on optimizing blockchain consensus computations in post-quantum cryptography using topological quantum error correction and fault-tolerant codes
- Simultaneously conducting research on the application of topological quantum neural networks to renormalization group flow in quantum gravity and quantum computing theory
- Iâ€™m interested in collaborating on:
  - topological quantum neural networks
  - quantum information/computing theory
  - post-quantum cryptography
