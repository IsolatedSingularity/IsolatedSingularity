- Conducting research on optimizing distributed consensus protocols in quantum cryptography using topological data analysis techniques
- Simultaneously developing systematic quantum algorithms for characterizing thermalization behavior and quantum chaos in integrable and non-integrable quantum systems
- Iâ€™m interested in collaborating on:
  - Quantum algorithms
  - Optimization
  - Quantum error correction
