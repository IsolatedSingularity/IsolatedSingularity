- Conducting research on optimizing distributed consensus protocols in quantum cryptography using topological data analysis techniques
- Simultaneously developing a rigorous axiomatic framework for holographic quantum error correction in many-body quantum systems with infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces
- Iâ€™m interested in collaborating on:
  - Quantum algorithms
  - Quantum error correction
  - Quantum cryptography
