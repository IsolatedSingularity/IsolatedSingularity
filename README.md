- Conducting research on optimizing robust consensus protocols in post-quantum cryptography using persistent homology and topological data analysis techniques
- Simultaneously conducting research on the application of holography for quantum tasks in quantum many-body systems
- Iâ€™m interested in collaborating on:
  - quantum cryptography
  - quantum error correction
  - quantum information theory
