- Conducting research on the application of topological quantum neural networks to renormalization group flow in quantum gravity and confined systems of entangled qubits
- Previous research was on qubit networks and wormholes in quantum computing theory
- Iâ€™m interested in collaborating on:
  - quantum information/computing theory
  - quantum neural networks
  - interdisciplinary simulations in data science
