- Conducting research on the application of topological quantum field theory to topological quantum neural networks for more efficient quantum computation
- Simultaneously conducting research on optimizing robust consensus protocols in post-quantum cryptography using persistent homology and topological data analysis techniques
- Iâ€™m interested in collaborating on:
  - topological quantum neural networks
  - quantum information/computing theory
  - quantum gravity
