- Conducting research on the application of topological quantum field theory to quantum neural networks for more efficient quantum computation
- Simultaneously conducting research on optimizing consensus in post-quantum cryptography using low-dimensional topology
- Iâ€™m interested in collaborating on:
  - topological quantum neural networks
  - quantum information/computing theory
  - post-quantum cryptography
