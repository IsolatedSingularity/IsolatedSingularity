- Conducting research on qubit networks and wormholes in quantum computing/information theory
- Upcoming research will be the application of quantum neural networks to renormalization group flow in quantum gravity 
- Iâ€™m interested in collaborating on:
  - interdisciplineary simulations in data science
  - theoretical quantum computing
  - quantum neural networks
